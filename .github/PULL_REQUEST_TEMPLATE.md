## How does your Pacman work?

_Provide a brief explanation of your model's behavior, what information it uses, and any fancy algorithms employed (e.g., reinforcement learning techniques, neural networks, heuristics, etc.):_

## Checklist:

I ensure that I:
- [ ] have included my model's weights (the `.json` file) in my commit
- [ ] have configured the tournament behavior to use those weights
- [ ] copied over any code needed to run my model (e.g., all inputs to the neural network)
- [ ] tested the tournament at least once before submission (just to make sure everything is working)
- [ ] have not intentionally modified the game state in any way
